Billion may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>

            <p>Billion may sell, rent, or lease customer information to third parties in order to offer you enhancements to the Products and Services, for advertising purposes, or to offer you third party products and services that may be of interest to you.</p>

            <p>Billion may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. Billion may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Billion, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>

            <p>Billion may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Billion, in order to determine what Billion services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Billion to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>

            <p>Billion will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Billion or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Billion; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Billion, or the public.</p>

            <p>Billion may offer the ability for you to remove content and materials that you have previously submitted to the Products and Services. If you use these features, you acknowledge that such data may not be immediately erased, due to the mechanisms of the removal procedures or the use of backup copies.</p>

            <p>Please be aware that even if you use these features to remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users or systems.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge that discontinued use of the Products and Services does not imply that previously submitted content and materials are deleted from the systems that provide the Products and Services.</p>

            <h2>Use of Cookies, Pixels and Other Technologies</h2>

            <p>The Billion website may use “cookies”, “pixels”, and other similar technologies such as local storage and caching, for authentication, to enhance security, to help you personalize your online experience, for advertising, and for performance, analytics and research. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

            <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Billion pages, or register with Billion products or services, a cookie helps Billion to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Billion website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Billion features that you customized.</p>

            <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Billion services or websites you visit.</p>

            <p>A pixel (also known as page tags or web beacons) is a small image or piece of code embedded in a web page, email, or similar medium, that allows for analytics, such as whether a user has viewed an email.</p>

            <p>Local storage and caching are technologies similar to cookies that allow for the storage of small amounts of data in your browser, in order to facilitate faster or more personalized experiences on subsequent visits.</p>

            <p>We may also use third party products and services that use these technologies in order to provide advertising, collect analytics about the usage of our products and services, to measure and improve performance, and for other purposes.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>

            <p>To secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, Billion uses industry standard technologies such as encryption and access controls to servers.</p>

            <p>When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

            <p>When your information is shared with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, your data is secured according to those third party’s privacy policies.</p>
